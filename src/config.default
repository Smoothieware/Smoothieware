# This is a place for the user to specify their own 'firm' defaults at compile time
# One can also use this as the primary config system if an sdcard is unavailable
# The format of this file is identical to that of a normal config file
#
# to have git ignore this file so you can keep your own defaults in here that are
# preserved through updates run this command:
# git update-index --assume-unchanged src/config.default
