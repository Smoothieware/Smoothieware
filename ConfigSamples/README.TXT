These subdirectories contain samples of config files that can be used with the
Smoothie software to configure it for your particular setup.  To use one of
these configuration files with your Smoothie software, just copy the "config"
file found in the appropriate directory to the root of the uSD card on your
Smoothie enabled hardware.

The full configs found in the ConfigSamples director include:
* Smoothieboard - This directory contains a sample configuration for the
  most recent Smoothieboard. http://smoothieware.org/smoothieboard

* Smoothieboard.delta - This directory contains a sample config for a
  Rostock or Kossel style linear delta bot using the most recent Smoothieboard.

* AzteegX5Mini - This directory contains a sample config file for using
  the Azteeg X5 Mini.

* Snippets - these are snippets of config that can be included in the main config or copy pasted.

There are also example config fragments to be be found in the rest of the docs.
