## Motor driver configuration
motor_driver_control.driver.enable               true			 # Enable motor driver module
motor_driver_control.driver.axis                 X				 # Axis designator on which the motor driver is set 
motor_driver_control.driver.chip                 TMC2208 		 # Motor driver chip type
motor_driver_control.driver.sw_uart_tx_pin       0.27            # Transmitting line from the board to the driver

#motor_driver_control.driver.sw_uart_baudrate    9600            # Software UART baudrate. Value higher than 50k is not recommended
#motor_driver_control.driver.current             1000            # Motor currents in mA
#motor_driver_control.driver.sense_resistor      50				 # Sensing resistor value as a reference in milliohms
#motor_driver_control.driver.microsteps          16              # Set microstepping value per step pulse. It can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 microsteps
#motor_driver_control.driver.mode                0               # 0 = spreadCycle ; 1 = stealthChop
