/* In the M0, there is no VTOR. In the LPC range such as the LPC11U,
 * whilst the vector table may only be something like 48 entries (192 bytes, 0xC0), 
 * the SYSMEMREMAP register actually remaps the memory from 0x10000000-0x100001FF 
 * to adress 0x0-0x1FF. In this case, RAM can be addressed at both 0x10000000 and 0x0
 * 
 * If we just copy the vectors to RAM and switch the SYSMEMMAP, any accesses to FLASH
 * above the vector table before 0x200 will actually go to RAM. So we need to provide 
 * a solution where the compiler gets the right results based on the memory map
 *
 * Option 1 - We allocate and copy 0x200 of RAM rather than just the table
 *  - const data and instructions before 0x200 will be copied to and fetched/exec from RAM
 *  - RAM overhead: 0x200 - 0xC0 = 320 bytes, FLASH overhead: 0
 * 
 * Option 2 - We pad the flash to 0x200 to ensure the compiler doesn't allocate anything there  
 *  - No flash accesses will go to ram, as there will be nothing there
 *  - RAM only needs to be allocated for the vectors, as all other ram addresses are normal
 *  - RAM overhead: 0, FLASH overhead: 320 bytes
 *
 * Option 2 is the one to go for, as RAM is the most valuable resource
