==Overview
Smoothie is a free, opensource, high performance G-code interpreter and CNC controller written in Object-Oriented C++ for the LPC17xx micro-controller ( ARM Cortex M3 architecture ). It will run on a mBed, a LPCXpresso, a SmoothieBoard, R2C2 or any other LPC17xx-based board. The motion control part is a port of the awesome grbl.

==Quick Start
These are the quick steps to get Smoothie/gcc4mbed dependencies installed on your computer:
* Pull down a clone of the Smoothie github project to your local machine.
* In the gcc4mbed subdirectory of the cloned Smoothie project, there are install scripts for the supported platforms.  Run the install script appropriate for your platform:
** Windows: win_install.cmd
** OS X: mac_install
** Linux: linux_install
* You can then run the BuildShell script which will be created during the install to properly configure the PATH environment variable to point to the required version of GCC for ARM which was just installed on your machine.  You may want to edit this script to further customize your development environment.

More information on the gcc4mbed project can be found [[https://github.com/adamgreen/gcc4mbed|here]].

==Building Smoothie
From a shell, switch into the root Smoothie project directory and run:
{{{
make clean all
make flash
}}}
