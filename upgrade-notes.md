To upgrade from an old master or old edge to the new motion control firmware
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If upgrading from a build prior to July 1, 2016....

The following changes must be made to your config

1. ```alpha_max_travel, beta_max_travel, gamma_max_travel``` must be correctly defined for homing to work properly
   they control the maximum distance the axis will move before it gives up finding the home switch. They are currently set to ```alpha_max, beta_max and Gamma_max``` (or 500) if not found in the config file.
NOTE on a delta this needs to be the total hieght (or greater) than yur towers NOT the same as gamma_max.

2. it is best to start from a fresh config

3. you must delete the config-override (M502) as M203 format has changed (M203 sets cartesian max speeds, M203.1 sets actuator max speeds, no longer uses ABC as these are now reserved for future n-axis). (or for a short while just do M500 as the  A B C will be read until it is deprecated, and M500 will save it in the new format)

4. Homing is slightly different, by default it will home X and Y axis at the same time then Z, this can be reversed and have Z home first then X and Y.
   the homing_order setting still works the same way as before.

5. The old extruder syntax is no longer allowed so check your config has the latest extruder config like
   ```
   extruder.hotend.enable                          true             # Whether to activate the extruder module at all. All configuration is ignored if false
   extruder.hotend.steps_per_mm                    710              # Steps per mm for extruder stepper
   extruder.hotend.default_feed_rate               600              # Default rate ( mm/minute ) for moves where only the extruder moves
   etc
   ```
   
   and not the old
   
   ```
   extruder_module_enable                       true
   ```

6. If you use volumetric extrusion (M200 D2.85) then note that unlike the current edge, G1 E5 will extrude 5mmÂ³ not 5mm. Note that in slic3r there is now a smootheware flavor you need to select for gcode generation, which fixes an issue with firmware retract.

7. if you have configured more than 2 extruders you will need to recompile and set ```MAX_ROBOT_ACTUATORS``` accordingly.. https://github.com/Smoothieware/Smoothieware/blob/edge/src/modules/robot/ActuatorCoordinates.h#L17

The following changes must be made to your hardware
---------------------------------------------------

1. Due to a mistake in the previous versions of the firmware the E direction was reversed, so you must invert your dir pin for your extruders (or reverse the extruder plug) from how they were before.
